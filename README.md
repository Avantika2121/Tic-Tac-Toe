My favorite function would be for switchTurns() that i used for player to take turns. But in general logic/pseudocode of this game is more of value to me.

For coding i used JavaScript, JQuery here and there as i don't know it in depth and HTML/CSS for webpage and designing.

I think i have been able to keep it DRY and logic as simple as possible for me.
